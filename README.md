# MathGroupsAPI

Mathematical words and phrases meaning the same thing (English only, for now)

Word groupings are important. Our brains do this automatically, without really thinking once we have mastered a language. 

Mathematics is a universal language. Most students, at a very young age, master simple mathematical terms and phrases at a very young age. However, when working with artificial intellegence, we need to create word groupings for mathematics (and other topics) so that artificial intellegence can decern what terms or phrases we are talking about and in what context and seemlessly change context without missing a beat. 

I will also argue that artifical intellegence, at this point, can not decern a lot of things, including course correction. It fails miserably!
